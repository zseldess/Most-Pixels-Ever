This is an example of using an async client to do all the computational work, with synchronous clients that simply draw what the async client tells them to (no brains).

This example draws resizable and moveable buttons. Left-click and drag to move a button around. Right-click or Ctlr-click and drag to resize a button.
 
In this example, the Asynchronous client reorders the contents of the message to control the render order of the buttons (e.g. selected button always renders in front of all other buttons).

To run this test:

1. Start the server
	- cd to the server/ folder
	- in Terminal, run
		java -jar mpeServer.jar -listener -listenPort9003 -framerate60 -screens1

2. Start AsyncClient
	-double-click the mpeAsyncClient app

3. Start the Client
	-double-click the mpeClient app
